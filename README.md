# Overview:

This repository consists of a jupyter notebook that focuses on building a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the purchaseValue - the total amount spent during a user session on a large-scale digital commerce platform. The dataset contains rich, session-level data with features spanning user behaviour, technical device attributes, acquisition channels, and geographical indicators. The project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Various regression models are compared, and the final selected model is optimised to achieve a high RÂ² score on the public leaderboard of Kaggle. The goal is to apply best practices in real-world machine learning workflows and demonstrate proficiency in handling complex tabular data for predictive modelling.
